33.  GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY 
34.  WHERE 
35.  the source 
36. : The conditions outlined in the text are crucial for the persistence of group functions, as they ensure the integrity and continuity of operations, preventing degradation or loss of functionality over time. 
37.  a specific threshold 
38. The process involves checking employee counts, applying specific functions and ensuring****: The text discusses the process of managing and filtering data related to employees in different sections, focusing on conditions such as the number of employees being more than a specific threshold (e.g., 2000). It highlights the importance of organizing and applying functions to the data, ensuring the correct order of operations and filtering out irrelevant information. The process involves checking employee counts, applying specific functions, and ensuring the data aligns with the required criteria 
39. :** The text outlines a multi-step process where employees are first counted and then distributed into sections based on predefined criteria. The criteria include the name or identifier of each section, and the distribution is verified through a series of steps to ensure accuracy and fairness. The process involves both numerical counting and qualitative assessments to allocate employees appropriately.
