- The transformer architecture is explained by breaking down its components step by step.
- The term "vector" is defined using a medical example, where patient data (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure) is represented as a vector in multiple dimensions.
- Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a specific measurement, and the combination of these measurements forms the vector representation of the patient.

****************************************************************

4. Context-Independent Embeddings: The same word has the same embedding regardless of its position in the sentence, which can be a limitation.

****************************************************************

Points:
- The position of a value in a sequence determines its meaning and the new values it can produce.

- The goal is to refine these weights to achieve improved results.

****************************************************************

Points:
- Matrix multiplication results in a new matrix called "d_model" with the same inner dimension.
- The concept of "head" involves dividing the matrix into multiple parts, each with a specific number of columns.
- The total number of columns across all heads equals the original matrix's columns.
- The number of heads is optional and can vary based on implementation.
- The final output combines all the heads.

****************************************************************

Points: - The attention matrix is manipulated by masking future words to prevent the model from using them for predictions. - The diagonal and values above it in the matrix are set to negative infinity to ensure future words do not influence current predictions. - This technique is crucial for causal models, where the model should only rely on past and present information. - Normalization is applied to the matrix before softmax to scale the values and improve training stability. - The masked head attention mechanism improves the transformer's efficiency by forcing it to focus on relevant past information.
